# add a tip at the top of the menu start screen "hit ESC to bring up the menu WARNING:game state lost " 
(maybe implement some way to return to the current game)
# add a controls section of the main menu
# add a menu condition for when you win the game to enter your name and save the score to the leaderboard
# fix all bugs

# Add comments and docstrings when program is complete
# run through your code at the end and add error handling
# see if you can optimise each line of code, maybe you've reused certain code that could be used in a function

# implement the game onto your website, hosted by AWS or something similar so you can have server space for
the leaderboard
